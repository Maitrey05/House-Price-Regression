# House Price Prediction

This repository explores the use of machine learning to predict house prices. 

**Dataset**

The project utilizes a house price regression dataset containing information about various properties, including:

* **Size (square footage, number of rooms)**
* **Location (neighborhood, proximity to amenities)**
* **Age and condition of the property**
* **Number of bathrooms and bedrooms**
* **Presence of features like a garage, fireplace, or pool**

**Methodology**

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
   - Load the dataset and handle missing values.
   - Perform feature engineering (e.g., create new features, encode categorical variables).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze data distributions, identify correlations, and visualize relationships between features and the target variable (sale price).

3. **Model Training:**
   - Train various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Neural Networks).
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

4. **Model Selection and Optimization:**
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
   - Fine-tune model hyperparameters for optimal performance.
